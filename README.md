# pear-electron

> Pear User-Interface Library for Electron

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

```sh
npm install pear-electron
```

## Usage

Ensure the `package.json` `pear` configuration object contains a `pre` field pointing to `pear-electron/pre`.

```js
{
  "pear": {
    "pre": "pear-electron/pre"
  }
}
```

Instantiate a `pear-electron` runtime instance from a Pear Application's entrypoint JavaScript file:

```js
import Runtime from 'pear-electron'
import Bridge from 'pear-bridge'

const runtime = new Runtime()

const bridge = new Bridge()
await bridge.ready()

const pipe = runtime.start({ bridge })
Pear.teardown(() => pipe.end())
```

Call `runtime.start` to open the UI.

> NOTE: naming the import `Runtime` instead of `PearElectron` is intentional, for two reasons. The `pear-electron` import resolves to a runtime start library or a User Interface library depending on environment and using `Runtime` and `ui` as assigned names means switching out `pear-electron` with an equivalent alternative only involves changing the two `pear-electron` import specifiers.

Given an `index.html` containing `<script src="./app.js"></script>` in `app.js` import `pear-electron` User Interface API:

```js
import ui from 'pear-electron'
```

## Application Configuration <a name="application-configuration"></a>

Set the [`pear.pre`](https://docs.pears.com/configuration#pear-pre) to `pear-electron/pre` (or ensure that it's imported at the top of any alternative pre script).

```json
{
  "pear": {
    "pre": "pear-electron/pre"
  }
}
```

Prior to run from disk and prior to run from key, the `pear-electron/pre` script automatically adjusts application configuration to include runtime binary [`pear.assets`](https://docs.pears.com/configuration#pear-assets) as well as adding statically analyzed script tags as [`pear.stage.entrypoints`](https://docs.pears.com/configuration#pear-stage-entrypoints) from the [`pear.gui.main`](#pear-gui-main) HTML entrypoint.

The application `package.json` `pear` field can also define its own [`pear.assets`](https://docs.pears.com/configuration#pear-assets).

## Initialization API <a name="initialization-api"></a>

### `new Runtime() -> runtime` <a name="new-runtime"></a>

Create the runtime instances with `new Runtime()`.

### `runtime.ready()` <a name="runtime-ready"></a>

Prepare the runtime, runtime binaries for the runtime version may be bootstrapped peer-to-peer at this point. This only runs once per version and any prior bootstraps can be reused for subsequent versions where state hasn't changed. In a production scenario any bootstrapping would be performed in advance by the application distributable.

### `runtime.start(opts)` <a name="runtime-start"></a>

Opens the UI.

#### Options

- `bridge` - An instance of [`pear-bridge`](https://github.com/holepunchto/pear-bridge).

## User-Interface API <a name="user-interface-api"></a>

Inside the `pear-electron` runtime desktop application, pear-electron resolves to a UI control API.

**index.html**:

```html
<script src="./app.js" type="module"><script>
```

**app.js**:

```js
import ui from 'pear-electron'
// do something with ui:
setTimeout(async () => {
  await ui.app.focus({ steal: true })
})
```

> NOTE: naming the import `ui` instead of `PearElectron` is intentional, for two reasons. The `pear-electron` import resolves to a runtime start library or a User Interface library depending on environment and using `Runtime` and `ui` as assigned names means switching out `pear-electron` with an equivalent alternative only involves changing the two `pear-electron` import specifiers.

### `ui.app <Object>` <a name="ui-app"></a>

UI Application controls

### `const success = await ui.app.focus([options <Object>])` <a name="ui-app-focus"></a>

Resolves to: `<Boolean>`

Foreground current view or window.

**Options**

- `steal` Default: `false` - focus input as well as foregrounding

### `const success = await ui.app.blur()` <a name="ui-app-blur"></a>

Resolves to: `<Boolean>`

Blur current view or window.

### `const success = await ui.app.show()` <a name="ui-app-show"></a>

Resolves to: `<Boolean>`

Show current view or window.

### `const success = await ui.app.hide()` <a name="ui-app-hide"></a>

Resolves to: `<Boolean>`

Hide current view or window.

#### `const success = await ui.app.badge(count <Integer|null>)` <a name="ui-app-badge"></a>

Resolves to: `<Boolean>`

Set the badge number for the application on desktop for Linux & MacOS. Setting the `count` to `0` will hide the badge while `null` will display a plain dot on MacOS only.

Returns a `Boolean` promise for whether the call succeeded.

#### `const untray = await ui.app.tray(options <Object>[, listener <Function>])` <a name="ui-app-tray"></a>

Resolves to: `<Function>`

Configure a tray icon for the application.

This method will return a promise which resolves to an `untray()` function for removing the tray.

The `listener` function is triggered whenever a menu item or the tray icon is clicked. It receives a single argument `key` that represents the menu item `key` that was clicked or the special value of `'click'` for when the menu icon itself was clicked. If no `listener` function is provided, a default listener will show the application window when triggered with `'click'` or `'show'` and quits with `'quit'`.

A Pear application should set `pear.gui.closeHide` option to `true` in `package.json` `pear` options object when using `ui.app.tray`.

WARNING: Linux tray support varies which can cause scenarios where the application's tray doesn't work and closing the app will be hidden and inaccessible. Using a tray and `closeHide` on Linux is not recommended. Set `pear.gui.linux.closeHide` option to `false` in `package.json` `pear` options object.

**Options**

- `icon <String>` Default: The Pear icon - The path for icon for the tray
  relative to the project root. Supported formats: PNG & JPEG
- `menu <Object>` Default: ``{ show: `Show ${Pear.app.name}`, quit: 'Quit' }`` - The
  tray menu items. Each property of the object is the `key` passed to the
  `listener` and whose value is the text displayed in the menu.
- `os <Object>` Default: `{ win32: true, linux: true, darwin: true  }` - which
  platforms support using the tray menu. The platform is checked via the
  `process.platform` value.

## Graphical User Interface Options <a name="pear-gui"></a>

GUI options for an application are set in the application `package.json` `pear.gui` field.

Example `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "pear": {
    "gui": {
      "width": 800,
      "height": 600

```json
{
  "pear": {
    "gui": {
      "darwin": {
        "resizable": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The following `platform`s are supported:

- `darwin`
- `linux`
- `win32`

## Web APIs <a name="web-apis"></a>

Most [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) will work as-is.

This section details deviations in behavior from and notable aspects of Web APIs as they relate to `pear-electron`.

### `window.open`

The [`window.open`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open) Web API function will ignore all arguments except for the URL parameter.

In browsers, `window.open` opens a new browser window. The opened window belongs to the same browser from which `window.open` is called.

With `pear-electron` UI Library, `window.open` loads the URL in the **default system browser**. It does _not_ create a new application window (use `Pear.Window` to create application windows).

Therefore Pear's `window.open` only supports a single URL argument. The `target` and `windowFeatures` parameters that browsers support are discarded.

### Scripts and Modules <a name="scripts-and-modules"></a>

Like browsers, there is no support for CommonJS (e.g. the `require` function as used by Node.js is not supported in Pear Applications).

Like browsers, there is support for native EcmaScript Modules (ESM). A JavaScript Script has no module capabilities. A JavaScript Module has ESM capabilities.

Use `<script type="module" src="path/to/my-file.js">` to load a JavaScript Module.

Use `<script src="path/to/my-file.js">` to load a JavaScript Script.

## Development <a name="development"></a>

The `pear-electron` library is a Pear User Interface Runtime Library, providing multiple capabilities:

- When loaded into a pear entrypoint JS file, `pear-electron` exports `runtime.js`, the runtime initializor.
- When loaded into electron, `pear-electron` exports a UI library that is injected via `Pear[Pear.constructor.UI]` inside the runtime build that becomes the asset defined on `pear.assets.ui` configuration.
- The `pear-electron/pre` script provides autoconfiguration, it sets `pear.assets.ui` on the application per `pear.assets.ui` in the `pear-electron/package.json`.

The `pear-electron` repo is self-bootstrapping and generates the runtime drive with `by-arch`, `prebuilds` and `boot.bundle`, which can then be staged with Pear.

```sh
npm run prestage
```

```sh
pear stage dev
```

Set the `package.json` `pear.assets.ui.link` to the versioned pear link (`pear://<fork>.<length>.<key>`) of the staged application. This means the `pear-electron/pre` of the next publish of `pear-electron` will autoconfigure the applications `pear.assets.ui` to the updated versioned pear link. This effectively locks runtime builds for a given SemVer to a specific runtime drive checkout.

To check a change with an application, use `npm pack` to get `tar.gz` archive and then install that archive into an application:

```sh
cd pear-electron
npm pack
cd ../some-pear-app
npm i ../pear-electron/name-of-the-tar.gz
```

Then run the app with the `-d` (development) and `--pre-io` flag (to see any output from the `pear-electron/pre` script).

```sh
pear run --pre-io -d .
```
